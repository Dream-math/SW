The [CVA6 RISC-V CPU](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) and [Ara](https://github.com/pulp-platform/ara) are  completely open-source
implementation of RISC-V.

This target is ideal for getting familiarize with RISC-V ISA instructions set and
freedom-metal libraries. It supports:

- 1 hart with RV32IMAC core
- 4 hardware breakpoints
- 16 local interrupts signal that can be connected to off core complex devices
- Up to 26 PLIC interrupt signals that can be connected to off core complex devices, with 7 priority levels
